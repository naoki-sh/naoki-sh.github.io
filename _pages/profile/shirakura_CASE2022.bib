  abstract = {Diversity and inclusion in industries is a new and challenging problem. Owing to declining birthrates and aging populations, it is becoming difficult to recruit workers at various industrial sites. Automation is one solution to overcome this problem. However, technical limitations make it difficult to automate all industries entirely. Therefore, it is expected that more diverse people, such as the elderly and those with poor skills for necessary work, will participate in various industries. Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is an approach that can balance the loads of humans and machines while allowing for their limitations. If robots can understand human workloads and work capacity sufficiently, it will be possible to collaborate while employing {"}diversified people{"} and maintaining productivity. This paper presents a human-robot collaboration (HRC) system which balance human workload and system productivity by using time pressure. To adjust time pressure using a real robot, we introduce a task scheduler that determines the intervention timing considering the movement limitation of the system and an interaction system using perception modality according to the work content. Our system was evaluated through a subjective experiment. In the experiment, workload and productivity were estimated using a physiological signal such as pupil diameter, subjective evaluation, and operation time. The result shows that the proposed HRC system can control time pressure, which can affect human workload and productivity.},
