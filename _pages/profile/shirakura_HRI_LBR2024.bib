  abstract = {This paper proposes a feedback framework that adjusts human workload and productivity by instructing work tempo and personalizes work according to individual differences. For feedback of optimal work tempo, this study proposes a human worker state transition model to investigate the effects of work tempo instructions on workload and productivity. Based on the results obtained, we proposed a feedback policy using our proposed worker state transition model. By testing our proposed framework in a picking task, we showed the possibility to balance productivity and workload.},
